# 100 Days of C++

Welcome to my **100 Days of C++** challenge! 🚀  
This repository contains my daily progress, programs, and notes as I learn and master C++ step-by-step.

# 📅 About the Challenge
The **100 Days of C++** challenge is my personal journey to improve problem-solving skills and understand both the fundamentals and advanced concepts of C++.  
I will be committing at least **one program per day** for 100 days.

# 📚 Learning Roadmap
Here’s the plan I’ll follow throughout the challenge:

1. **Basics & Syntax**
   - Hello World
   - Variables & Data Types
   - Input / Output
2. **Operators & Control Flow**
   - Arithmetic, Logical, Relational Operators
   - if-else, switch
   - Loops: for, while, do-while
3. **Functions**
   - Function Basics
   - Function Overloading
   - Recursion
4. **Arrays & Strings**
5. **Pointers & References**
6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
7. **Advanced C++ Features**
8. **Standard Template Library (STL)**
9. **Mini Projects**
